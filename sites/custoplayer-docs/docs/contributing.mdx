# Contributing

## Development

If you would like to contribute by fixing an open issue or developing a new feature you can use this suggested workflow:

- First fork the repository,
  - Create a new feature branch off the `main` branch.
- Second, install the dependencies of the monorepo:

```bash
yarn install
```

- Build the library:

```bash
cd packages/custoplayer && yarn build
```

- Run the development server of the test project:

```bash
yarn dev
```

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

- Make and commit desired changes.

  - Make sure to run `yarn lint --fix` before commiting to ensure that there are no linting errors.

- Finally, submit a pr from your forked branch to the Custoplayer main branch
